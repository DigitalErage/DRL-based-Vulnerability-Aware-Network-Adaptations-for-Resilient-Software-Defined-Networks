# DRL-based-Vulnerability-Aware-Network-Adaptations-for-Resilient-Software-Defined-Networks
This project is called "Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Vulnerability-Aware Network Adaptations for Resilient Software-Defined Networks".

This project is based on the paper “DREVAN:Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Vulnerability-Aware Network Adaptations for Resilient Networks” published in The ninth annual IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (IEEE CNS), Oct. 2021, the paper “Network Resilience Under Epidemic Attacks: Deep Reinforcement Learning Network Topology Adaptations” published in The 2021 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM), Dec. 2021, and the paper “EVADE: Efficient Moving Target Defense for Autonomous Network Topology Shuffling Using Deep Reinforcement Learning” published in The 21st International Conference on Applied Cryptography and Network Security (ACNS), Jun. 2023.

You can check the codes, papers, and slides in the corresponding subfolders.
